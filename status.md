Last Updated: March 3, 2025

## Executive Summary
This investigation into drone sightings near sensitive installations in the Northeastern United States has confirmed multiple official investigations are underway. Most significantly, FBI documentation confirms the existence of an active law enforcement investigation into drone activity in New Jersey since November 2024.

## FOIA/OPRA Request Status

| Agency | Request Date | ID Number | Status | Key Findings |
|--------|-------------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| FBI | Dec 29, 2024 | 56d3f3f/1655843-000 | DENIED | Records exist but exempt due to active investigation (b)(7)(A) |
| FAA | Dec 27, 2024 | 2025-01396 | IN PROGRESS | Extension requested until Feb 24, 2025 |
| NJDEP | Dec 27, 2024 | 367891/367890 | PARTIAL | Some records released, others exempt as inter-agency advisory |
| DHS I&A | Dec 28, 2024 | Pending | PENDING | No response received yet |
| NJSP | Not submitted | N/A | DRAFTING | Request in preparation |

## Confirmed Findings
1. **Active FBI Investigation**: FBI has confirmed they possess records on unidentified drone activity in New Jersey but cannot release them due to active law enforcement proceedings.
2. **11 Confirmed Drone Sightings**: NJDEP records reference a news article confirming 11 drone sightings at NJ military bases.
3. **Multi-Agency Coordination**: Communications between NJDEP officials indicate coordination on the drone sightings issue.

## Data Collection Progress
- Public records requests: 4 submitted, 3 with responses received
- Project organization structure: Complete
- Document management system: Implemented with hierarchical organization
- Email export: In progress via Google Takeout

## Next Steps
1. Follow up on overdue DHS I&A request
2. Finalize and submit NJSP request
3. Complete analysis of NJDEP partial records
4. Consider FBI appeal (though unlikely to succeed given active investigation status)
5. Import email communications into documentation system when Google Takeout completes

## Risk Factors
- Active law enforcement proceedings may limit information accessibility
- Agencies may broadly interpret exemptions
- Additional extension requests may delay information gathering

## Timeline Assessment
The investigation is proceeding on schedule. The confirmation of an active FBI investigation represents a significant validation of the project's premise that these drone sightings warrant serious attention.

## Resources Needed
- Review of FOIA appeal options and legal precedents
- Expansion of public reporting sources
- Potential consultation with drone technology experts

This status will be updated as new information becomes available or significant project milestones are reached.
