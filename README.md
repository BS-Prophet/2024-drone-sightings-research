Last Updated: March 3, 2025

## Project Mission
To document and analyze drone sightings near sensitive installations in the Northeastern United States, focusing on verified incidents from late 2024. This project leverages FOIA/OPRA requests and public reporting to ensure transparency and support public safety initiatives.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Collection:** Aggregate verified drone sightings and related documentation.
- **Analysis:** Identify geographical and temporal patterns.
- **Reporting:** Provide findings for public consideration and awareness.

## Key Findings
- **Active FBI Investigation:** FBI has confirmed possession of records related to drone activity in New Jersey but cannot release them due to active law enforcement proceedings
- **Confirmed Military Base Incidents:** Documentation of 11 drone sightings at NJ military installations
- **Multi-Agency Response:** Evidence of coordination between federal and state agencies

## Current Progress
- Received partial records from NJDEP regarding drone sightings at Naval Weapons Station Earle
- Confirmed documentation of drone incidents at military installations through OPRA responses
- Analyzing patterns and official responses to incidents
- Established comprehensive document organization system
- Created tracking system for all FOIA/OPRA requests
